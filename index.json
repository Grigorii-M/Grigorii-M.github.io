Lightweight markup language is a modern system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and designed with a simple readable syntax. In fact, the syntax is so basic that anyone can quickly learn to use these markup languages. The key advantage of this type of language is that it is designed to be easy to enter the annotated text in a text editor, and at the same time easy to follow the document source.\nThis type of language has plain text formats, with very simple special characters or strings that mark up section headers, lists, tables, link syntax, font faces and so on.\nThere are a number of uses for lightweight markup languages. We live in a world where there is a constant stream of emails, memos, articles, reports, and tweets. Many people write, rearrange and reuse text. Lightweight markup languages are helpful in this regard, saving lots of time over hand-crafted HTML tags, speeding up any writing-related process. They also are particularly strong where the reader wants to read the document source as well as the output. Moreover, they are frequently used in web-based publishing, including wikis and weblogs.\nBy using these open source tools, individuals can produce high quality annotated text within a few minutes, and at no cost at all. The code is portable, and can be output to documents in a wide array of formats.\nLet’s explore the 9 lightweight markup languages at hand. For each title we have compiled its own portal page, a full description with an in-depth analysis of its features, together with links to relevant resources.\n   Language Description     Markdown Markup language and Text-to-HTML conversion tool   MultiMarkdown Based on Markdown with additional features   GigHub Flavored Markdown For user content on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise   Markdown Extra Lightweight markup language based on Markdown   AsciiDoc Presentable text document format for writing articles   Textile Billed as a “humane web text generator”   Texy Text-to-XHTML formatter and converter library   Tome Markup Language and Tool Suite for Authors   reStructuredText Markup Syntax and Parser Component of Docutils    ","date":1652486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"908407b37431d2deb386fb6544a0cfe6","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markup/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markup/","section":"post","summary":"What are markup languages?","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Lightweight Markup Languages","type":"post"},{"authors":["Grigorii Matiukhin"],"categories":["Acomplishments"],"content":"The week The development of the 3D Engine mentioned in the previous post is in full swing.

In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably. Automated build-and-test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable. The code is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as a part of the CD process. In the software world, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that enables incremental code changes from developers’ desktops to be delivered quickly and reliably to production.\nWhy is CI/CD important? CI/CD allows organizations to ship software quickly and efficiently. CI/CD facilitates an effective process for getting products to market faster than ever before, continuously delivering code into production, and ensuring an ongoing flow of new features and bug fixes via the most efficient delivery method.\nWhat is the difference between CI and CD? Continuous integration (CI) is practice that involves developers making small changes and checks to their code. Due to the scale of requirements and the number of steps involved, this process is automated to ensure that teams can build, test, and package their applications in a reliable and repeatable way. CI helps streamline code changes, thereby increasing time for developers to make changes and contribute to improved software.\nContinuous delivery (CD) is the automated delivery of completed code to environments like testing and development. CD provides an automated and consistent way for code to be delivered to these environments.\nContinuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically placed in production, resulting in many production deployments.\nContinuous deployment should be the goal of most companies that are not constrained by regulatory or other requirements.\nIn short, CI is a set of practices performed as developers are writing code, and CD is a set of practices performed after the code is completed.\n","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"9e09c01627c1e4be7aa7f052f7f9698b","permalink":"https://example.com/post/ci-cd/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ci-cd/","section":"post","summary":"What is CI/CD and why is it so important?
